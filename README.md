# Healthcare Utilization & Diagnosis Insights  
*(An End-to-End Data Analysis Case Study)*

---

## Project Objectives & Motivation
Healthcare systems generate vast amounts of data that can be analyzed to uncover trends in utilization, diagnoses, and patient demographics. For this project, I used **synthetic healthcare data generated by Synthea** to ensure privacy while still allowing meaningful analysis.

**Objectives:**
1. Understand **patient demographics** (gender, race distributions).
2. Identify the **most prevalent medical conditions**.
3. Analyze **encounter types** and **readmission frequency**.
4. Explore **diagnostic trends over time**.
5. Build a **reproducible, end-to-end data pipeline** covering:
   - Data cleaning (Python/Jupyter)
   - Aggregation (SQL/PostgreSQL)
   - Visualization (Tableau)

## Workflow Overview
The project followed a structured, end-to-end data analysis approach:

1. **Data Source:** Synthetic patient data generated using **Synthea**.  
2. **Data Cleaning (Jupyter Notebook):**  
   - Checked for null values and duplicates  
   - Fixed data type inconsistencies  
   - Standardized categorical and date formats  
   - Prepared clean datasets for database ingestion  
3. **Data Aggregation (PostgreSQL):**  
   - Wrote SQL queries to compute summaries and insights  
   - Focused on demographics, top diagnoses, utilization, and readmissions  
4. **Visualization (Tableau):**  
   - Created interactive dashboards to showcase findings  
   - Visuals include bar charts, line charts, and heatmaps  
5. **Insights & Reporting:** Summarized key findings and potential next steps.# Healthcare Utilization and Diagnosis Insights

## Project Overview
This project leverages synthetic healthcare data generated by [Synthea](https://synthea.mitre.org/), ensuring no real patient data is used. SQL was utilized to preprocess and analyze the data, focusing on patient demographics, top 10 conditions, hospital utilization by encounter type, and readmission rates. The processed data was then visualized in Tableau to create a bar chart of top conditions, a line chart of diagnoses over time, and heatmap of encounter classes.

## Datasets
All datasets are synthetic, generated by Synthea, and contain no real patient information. The following datasets were used:
- **Hospital Utilization.xlsx**: Contains `encounter_class`, `total_visits`, and `avg_cost` for encounter types.
- **Top 10 conditions.xlsx**: Lists top 10 diagnoses with `description` and `diagnosis_count`.
- **Patients Demographic Overview.xlsx**: Provides patient demographics with `gender`, `race`, and `patient_count`.
- **Patients with more than 1 encounter.xlsx**: Tracks patients with multiple visits using `id` and `visits` for readmission analysis.
- **Diagnosis Data.xlsx**: Includes diagnosis data with `description`, `diagnosis_count`, `start_date`, and `stop_date` for time-based analysis.

## SQL Analysis
SQL queries were used to preprocess and aggregate the Synthea-generated data before visualization in Tableau. Some of the queries keyed in included:

### 1. Patient Demographics Overview
- **Objective**: Aggregate patient counts by gender and race.
  **Example SQL Query**:
  
  SELECT gender, race, COUNT(*) AS patient_count
  FROM patients
  GROUP BY gender, race
  ORDER BY patient_count DESC;

### 2. Top 10 Conditions Diagnosed
- **Objective**: Identify the top 10 conditions by diagnosis count.
  **Example SQL Query**:
  
SELECT description, COUNT(*) AS diagnosis_count
FROM conditions
GROUP BY description
ORDER BY diagnosis_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

### Visualizations
The SQL-processed datasets were imported into Tableau to create the following visualizations:

- Bar Chart: Displays the top 10 conditions (e.g., Viral sinusitis: 1,248 diagnoses).

- Line Chart: Tracks diagnosis counts over time using start_date, aggregated by month.

- Heatmap: Visualizes encounter distribution by class (e.g., wellness: 19,106 visits).

### Key Insights
- Wellness and ambulatory encounters dominate hospital utilization.

- Viral sinusitis is the most common condition.

- More female patients than male patients are represented in the dataset.

- A significant proportion of patients had multiple encounters, pointing to potential readmission challenges.

- Diagnoses show seasonal trends across months.

### Tools & Technologies

- SQL (PostgreSQL) – Data aggregation & preprocessing.

- Tableau – Dashboards and visual analytics.

- Excel – Intermediate dataset handling.

- Synthea – Synthetic healthcare data generator
